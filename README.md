A mod for The Long Dark that adds a renewable source of herbal tea.

# Details

The mod adds pine fascicles that can be found underneath trees. 

These can be gathered and after drying the needles can be prepared into a herbal tea or used as tinder.

The spawn rate of the fascicles can be adjusted via mod settings. 

The tea offers benefits such as having a lot of vitamin C as well as the improved sleep buff, although it is slightly weaker than the buff from regular herbal tea.
