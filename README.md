# Pine Needle Tea

A mod for The Long Dark that adds a renewable source of herbal tea.

The mod adds pine fascicles that can be found underneath trees, with adjustable spawn rates.

To brew them into tea, you have to gather a bunch and dry them indoors for a day. After that you can prepare 6 of them in the crafting menu to be brewed.

The tea contains a high amount of vitamin C, and offers the Improved Rest benefit, however it is weaker than the Herbal Tea.
