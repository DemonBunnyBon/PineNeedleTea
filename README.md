# Pine Needle Tea

A mod for The Long Dark that adds a renewable source of herbal tea.

The mod adds pine fascicles that can be found underneath trees, with adjustable spawn rates.

To brew them into tea, you have to gather a bunch and dry them indoors for a day. After that you can prepare 6 dried fascicles in the crafting menu to be brewed.
Prepared needles can serve as tinder.

The tea contains a high amount of vitamin C, which can be adjusted, and offers the Improved Rest benefit, however it is weaker than the Herbal Tea. 
Unlike Herbal Tea it restores 1 extra HP per hour instead of 2, additionally it only lasts 9 hours instead of 12.
